                            <h3>ART OF CHOICE: Pen & Ink and Watercolor</h3>
                            <p>SHORT BIO: I have been drawing since i was a child. I can remember my mother giving me a
                                pencil and
                                paper to draw to keep me occupied in church when I was Five or Six years old. I have
                                never
                                lost the
                                desire to create drawings, although I have gone through long periods of not creating art
                                because of
                                my work and life. When i retired i started putting more time into my artwork. I have
                                usually
                                worked
                                in pencil or pen and ink. About six years ago i did and ink drawing of and old door on
                                an
                                abandoned
                                house. That drawing sparked an interest in old structures and items and the use of pen
                                and
                                ink.
                                Since then i have fully embraced the medium of pen and ink. My subject material remains
                                old
                                barns,
                                buildings, farms, and objects.
                                <br>
                                I am now also starting to experiment with watercolor and look forward to becoming
                                proficient
                                in that
                                medium as well. I look at my work as stated on my business card...
                                <br>
                                "Saving the past in black and white and sometimes with a little color."
                                <br>
                                As about the uniqueness of my work, every artists is unique even if they study the same
                                subject. We all see and interpret things from our own point of view.

                            <p>My work is a labor of love to the people of America, and more specifically, to the people
                                who
                                have taken on the mantle of preserving the legacy of the rural American lifestyle. It is
                                my
                                belief that our rural roots hold a direct pathway to the Biblical foundation that is our
                                nation's most valuable resource and treasure. To lose sight of the Christian values our
                                country's rural culture historically embraces would be unthinkable.</p>

                            <p>SHORT BIO: I love color and culture and I think it shows in my art. Being in my studio
                                creating is one of my favorite places to be. I have not been formally trained in art but
                                I have
                                been drawing and painting most of my life. I encourage people to replace those prints on
                                your
                                walls that you bought at a store with original art. It can be very affordable, supports
                                an
                                artist doing what they love and creates character in your home. Plus, you never know,
                                you could
                                be buying a real future investment!</p>
